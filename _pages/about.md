I have 16 + years of experience in the IT industry experience across multiple industries (Retail and Mortgage Banking, Automobile Finance, Automobile Industry, Parking, Hotel Industry, Shipping Industry, Storage Industry) and multiple technologies (Data Science, ML, Python, Azure, Xamarin, MS Technologies).

My strength is to understand business problems quickly and leverage technology to solve them. I always keep learning newer technologies which helps me drive value for business teams.

I enjoy all the challenges this industry offers; delivery, technology, customer satisfaction, innovation and onÂ­going learning.
